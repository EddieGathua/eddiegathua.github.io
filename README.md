This is the first version of my personal portfolio website. 
I am using HTML, CSS and Javascript to make this website. 

This portfoilio website has five sections which are, HOME, ABOUT, PORTFOLIO, AND CONTACT.

The HOME section contains an image of myself and a brief description of who I am and the work I do as a programmer.

The ABOUT section has additional information on the kind of work I do such as "Projects Completed" and "Languages Used" and it has a Timeline section which showcases my time as a Web Developer and the different roles I have played in the different projects I have undertaken.

The PORTFOLIO section contains the different projects I have undertaken and the different links to those projects for perusal.
